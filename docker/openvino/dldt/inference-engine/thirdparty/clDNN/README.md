	More information on Intel® OpenCL™ drivers can be found [here](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/opencl-drivers).

We recommend to use latest for Linux [link](https://github.com/intel/compute-runtime/releases) and 24.20 driver for Windows [link](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/27803/Graphics-Intel-Graphics-Driver-for-Windows-10?v=t).

## Installation

### Building

Download [clDNN source code](https://github.com/01org/cldnn/archive/master.zip)
or clone the repository to your system:

```
    git clone  https://github.com/intel/cldnn.git
```

Satisfy all software dependencies and ensure that the versions are correct before building.

clDNN uses multiple 3<sup>rd</sup>-party components. They are stored in binary form in `common` subdirectory. Currently they are prepared for MSVC++ and GCC\*. They will be cloned with repository.

---

clDNN uses a CMake-based build system. You can use CMake command-line tool or CMake GUI (`cmake-gui`) to generate required solution.  
For Windows system, you can call in `cmd` (or `powershell`):
```shellscript
    @REM Generate 32-bit solution (solution contains multiple build configurations)...
    cmake -E make_directory build && cd build && cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015" ..
    @REM Generate 64-bit solution (solution contains multiple build configurations)...
    cmake -E make_directory build && cd build && cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" ..
```  
Created solution can be opened in Visual Studio 2015 or built using appropriate `msbuild` tool
(you can also use `cmake --build .` to select build tool automatically).

For Unix and Linux systems:
```shellscript
    @REM Create GNU makefile for release clDNN and build it...
    cmake -E make_directory build && cd build && cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. && make
    @REM Create Ninja makefile for debug clDNN and build it...
    cmake -E make_directory build && cd build && cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .. && ninja -k 20
```

You can call also scripts in main directory of project which will create solutions/makefiles for clDNN (they
will generate solutions/makefiles in `build` subdirectory and binary outputs will be written to `build/out` subdirectory):
- `create_msvc_mscc.bat` (Windows\*, Visual Studio\* 2015)
- `create_unixmake_gcc.sh [Y|N] [<devtoolset-version>]` (Linux\*, GNU\* or Ninja\* makefiles, optional devtoolset support)
    * If you specify the first parameter as `Y`, the Ninja makefiles will be generated.
    * If you specify second parameter (number), the CMake will be called via `scl` with selected `devtoolset` version.

CMake solution offers multiple options which you can specify using normal CMake syntax (`-D<option-name>=<value>`):

| CMake option                              | Type     | Description                                                                  |
|:------------------------------------------|:---------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| CLDNN\_\_IOCL\_ICD\_VERSION               | STRING   | Version of Intel® OpenCL™ ICD binaries and headers to use (from `common` subdirectory). It is automatically setected by CMake (highest version). Specify, if you have multiple versions and want to use different than automatically selected. |
|                                           |          |                                                                              |

|                                           |          |                                                                              |
| CLDNN__RUN_TESTS                          | BOOL     | Run tests after building `tests` project. This option requires `CLDNN__INCLUDE_TESTS` option to be `ON`. Default: `OFF` |

---

clDNN includes unit tests implemented using the googletest framework. To validate your build, run `tests` target, e.g.:

```
    make tests
```

(Make sure that both `CLDNN__INCLUDE_TESTS` and `CLDNN__RUN_TESTS` were set to `ON` when invoking CMake.)

### Generating documentation

Documentation is provided inline and can be generated in HTML format with Doxygen. We recommend to use latest
[Doxygen\*](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html) and [GraphViz\*](http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php).

Documentation templates and configuration files are stored in `docs` subdirectory. You can simply call:

```shellscript
    cd docs && doxygen
```
to generate HTML documentation in `docs/html` subdirectory.

There is also custom CMake target named `docs` which will generate documentation in `CLDNN__OUTPUT_BIN_DIR/html` directory. For example, when using Unix makefiles, you can run:
```
    make docs
```
in order to create it.

### Deployment

Special `install` target will place the API header files and libraries in `/usr/local`
(`C:/Program Files/clDNN` or `C:/Program Files (x86)/clDNN` on Windows). To change
the installation path, use the option `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>` when invoking CMake.
